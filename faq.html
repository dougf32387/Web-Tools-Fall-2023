                <dt id="1">Who is Little Richard?</dt>
                <dd>Richard Wayne Penniman (December 5, 1932 – May 9, 2020), known professionally as Little Richard, was
                    an American singer, pianist, and songwriter. He was an influential figure in popular music and
                    culture for seven decades. Described as the "Architect of Rock and Roll", Richard's most celebrated
                    work dates from the mid-1950s, when his charismatic showmanship and dynamic music, characterized by
                    frenetic piano playing, pounding back beat and powerful raspy vocals, laid the foundation for rock
                    and roll. Richard's innovative emotive vocalizations and uptempo rhythmic music also played a key
                    role in the formation of other popular music genres, including soul and funk. He influenced numerous
                    singers and musicians across musical genres from rock to hip hop; his music helped shape rhythm and
                    blues for generations.</dd>
                <dt id="2">What was Little Richard's First Hit?</dt>
                <dd>"Tutti Frutti" (1955), one of Richard's signature songs, became an instant hit, crossing over to the
                    pop charts in the United States and the United Kingdom. His next hit single, "Long Tall Sally"
                    (1956), hit No. 1 on the Billboard Rhythm and Blues Best-Sellers chart, followed by a rapid
                    succession of fifteen more in less than three years. His performances during this period resulted in
                    integration between white Americans and black Americans in his audience. In 1962, after a five-year
                    period during which Richard abandoned rock and roll music for born-again Christianity, concert
                    promoter Don Arden persuaded him to tour Europe. During this time, the Beatles opened for Richard on
                    some tour dates.
                <dt id="3">What Audiences did Little Richard Appeal to?</dt>
                <dd>Richard is cited as one of the first crossover black artists, reaching audiences of all races. His
                    music and concerts broke the color line, drawing black and white people together despite attempts to
                    sustain segregation. Many of his contemporaries, including Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Bill Haley,
                    Jerry Lee Lewis, the Everly Brothers, Gene Vincent, Pat Boone, and Eddie Cochran, recorded covers of
                    his works.</dd>
                <dt id="4">What Awards did Little Richard Earn?</dt>
                <dd>Richard was honored by many institutions. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as
                    part of its first group of inductees in 1986. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of
                    Fame. He was the recipient of Lifetime Achievement Awards from The Recording Academy and the Rhythm
                    and Blues Foundation. In 2015, Richard received a Rhapsody & Rhythm Award from the National Museum
                    of African American Music for his key role in the formation of popular music genres and helping to
                    bring an end to the racial divide on the music charts and in concert in the mid-1950s changing
                    American culture significantly. "Tutti Frutti" was included in the National Recording Registry of
                    the Library of Congress in 2010, which stated that his "unique vocalizing over the irresistible beat
                    announced a new era in music".</dd>
                <dt id="5">What are Some Details about Little Richards Early Life?</dt>
                <dd>Richard Wayne Penniman was born in Macon, Georgia, on December 5, 1932, the third of twelve children
                    of Leva Mae (née Stewart) and Charles "Bud" Penniman. His father was a church deacon and a brick
                    mason, who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub called the Tip In Inn. His
                    mother was a member of Macon's New Hope Baptist Church. Initially, his first name was supposed to
                    have been "Ricardo", but an error resulted in "Richard" instead. The Penniman children were raised
                    in a neighborhood of Macon called Pleasant Hill. In childhood, he was nicknamed "Lil' Richard" by
                    his family because of his small and skinny frame. A mischievous child who played pranks on
                    neighbors, he began singing in church and taking piano lessons at a young age. Possibly as a result
                    of complications at birth, he had a slight deformity that left one of his legs shorter than the
                    other. This produced an unusual gait, and he was mocked for his effeminate appearance.</dd>
                <dd>His family was very religious and joined various A.M.E., Baptist, and Pentecostal churches, with
                    some family members becoming ministers. He enjoyed the Pentecostal churches the most, because of
                    their charismatic worship and live music. He later recalled that people in his neighborhood sang
                    gospel songs throughout the day during segregation to keep a positive outlook, because "there was so
                    much poverty, so much prejudice in those days". He had observed that people sang "to feel their
                    connection with God" and to wash their trials and burdens away. Gifted with a loud singing voice, he
                    recalled that he was "always changing the key upwards" and that he was once stopped from singing in
                    church for "screaming and hollering" so loud, earning him the nickname "War Hawk". As a child, he
                    would "beat on the steps of the house, and on tin cans and pots and pans, or whatever" while
                    singing, which annoyed neighbors.</dd>
                <dd>His initial musical influences were gospel performers such as Brother Joe May, Sister Rosetta
                    Tharpe, Mahalia Jackson, and Marion Williams. May, a singing evangelist who was known as "the
                    Thunderbolt of the Middle West" because of his phenomenal range and vocal power, inspired Richard to
                    become a preacher. He credited the Clara Ward Singers for one of his distinctive hollers. Richard
                    attended Macon's Hudson High School, where he was a below-average student. He eventually learned to
                    play alto saxophone, joining his school's marching band while in fifth grade. While in high school,
                    he got a part-time job at Macon City Auditorium for local secular and gospel concert promoter Clint
                    Brantley. He sold Coca-Cola to crowds during concerts of star performers of the day such as Cab
                    Calloway, Lucky Millinder, and his favorite singer, Sister Rosetta Tharpe.</dd>

                <dt id="7">What Was Little Richard's Early Musical Career Like?</dt>
                <dd>In October 1947, Sister Rosetta Tharpe overheard the fourteen-year-old Richard singing her songs
                    before a performance at the Macon City Auditorium. She invited him to open her show. After the show,
                    Tharpe paid him, inspiring him to become a professional performer. Richard stated that his piano
                    style was greatly influenced by Ike Turner's piano intro on "Rocket 88". In 1949, he began
                    performing in Doctor Nubillo's traveling show. Richard was inspired to wear turbans and capes in his
                    career by Nubillo, who also "carried a black stick and exhibited something he called 'the devil's
                    child'—the dried-up body of a baby with claw feet like a bird and horns on its head." Nubillo told
                    Richard he was "gonna be famous".</dd>

                <dt id="8">What are Some Details of Little Richard's Early Success?</dt>
                <dd>Richard's next hit single, "Long Tall Sally" (1956), hit number one on the R&B chart and number
                    thirteen on the Top 100 while reaching the top ten in Britain. Like "Tutti Frutti", it sold over a
                    million copies. Following his success, Richard built up his backup band, The Upsetters, with the
                    addition of saxophonists Clifford "Gene" Burks and leader Grady Gaines, bassist Olsie "Baysee"
                    Robinson and guitarist Nathaniel "Buster" Douglas. Richard began performing on package tours across
                    the United States. Art Rupe described the differences between Richard and a similar hitmaker of the
                    early rock and roll period by stating that, while "the similarities between Little Richard and Fats
                    Domino for recording purposes were close," Richard would sometimes stand up at the piano while he
                    was recording, and that onstage, where Domino was "plodding, very slow", Richard was "very dynamic,
                    completely uninhibited, unpredictable, wild. So the band took on the ambience of the vocalist."
                    Richard's high-energy antics included lifting his leg while playing the piano, climbing on top of
                    his piano, running on and off the stage and throwing souvenirs to the audience. He also began using
                    capes and suits studded with multi-colored stones and sequins. Richard said he became more
                    flamboyant onstage so no one would think he was "after the white girls". Overall, Richard produced
                    seven singles in the United States alone in 1956, with five of them also charting in the UK,
                    including "Slippin' and Slidin'," "Rip It Up," "Ready Teddy," "The Girl Can't Help It" and
                    "Lucille."</dd>
